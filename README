    The objective of this project is to design, develop, and implement a promotional website for Ivy Games to advertise their upcoming new tabletop RPG, 
Caverns and Creatures. The main features include a personality quiz which will recommend a class and race to the user, 
information about the game, a newsletter sign-up, and the ability to purchase the game.
    Constraints of the project include a deadline of November 27, the experience of the development team, and the limits inherent with programming in 
HTML and CSS. Another constraint being the team must remain flexible enough to respond to any change requests made by Ivy Games during the development 
process.
Promotional website will run within a browser on a personal computer.  Users will require internet access and standard software for accessing 
websites only.  development teams will require means to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript code and access to gitHub and Google drive for sharing work.
