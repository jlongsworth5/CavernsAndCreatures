                TODO: Code retrieving information about which questions were answered
                on the quiz in order to select which type of result will be shown to
                the user. I *think* we can also write some code to select a passage
                to be displayed depending on what questions were answered

                Objective: Display the user's preferred character class and race,
                depending on how the answered the prior quiz. Coding/scripting will
                dictate which of these descriptions is actually shown to the user,
                out of the ones coded below

                <p><b>Warrior</b>: The Warrior is a skilled combatant whose toughness
                    and grit will see them through any challenge. &#34;I will

                </p>

                <p><b>Cleric</b>: The Cleric uses deep knowledge of the world,
                    both magic and mundane, to find solutions to overcome challenge.
                    &#34;Power comes not from the tip of the spear, but from
                    the wise application of its user.&#34;
                </p>

                <p><b>Chaplain</b>: Chaplains are the spiritual leaders of

                    User's recommended race possibilities; requires coding,
                    like the class section, to function as intended
                -->
                <p>Furthermore, your answers suggest that your character's
                    most suitable race is:
                </p>

                <p><b>Human</b>: Humans are a diverse group who occupy all levels
                    of society, possessing significant martial, political,
                    and economic power world-wide and able to use magic using
                    totems imbued with their spirit.  Humans have a rich and
                    varied history that spans the globe and influences all
                    things in their world with vast empires that each have
                    unique cultures, militaries, and lives.  Able to appeal
                    to many across the world, humans are solid all-rounders
                    who can excel in any role.
                </p>

                <p><b>Sindari</b>: respected everywhere, Sindari society stems from
                    a cultured past built on their innate ability to control
                    magic. They view the world through a philosophy of
                    &#34;Three Pillars&#34;&#58; the way of the warrior, the
                    wisdom of the teacher, and the spirit of the divine.
                    They can live for hundreds of years and spend their lives
                    in long phases where they strive to reach proficiency in
                    each pillar. They are revered for their skills and can
                    often be found in high places of society or are sought out
                    for their prowess in specific areas&#59; where there is
                    challenge, there is a Sindari seeking to master it.

                <p>Baluk: Organized into small tribes scattered across the
                    untamed lands between population centers, the Baluk are
                    rugged and renowned for their knowledge of survival and
                    warfare which is magically transposed intergenerationally
                    each time a Baluk overcomes challenges. They organize their
                    lives around trials of &#34;the Calmur&#34; where adolescents
                    embark on a pilgrimage to unlock their generational memories
                    before returning to their clans.  Baluk are strong and skilled&#59;
                    aspirants of pilgrimage often accompany adventurers and can draw on
                    generational wisdom from those in their clans even when far apart.
