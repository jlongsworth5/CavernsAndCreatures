                <p>Game Description:</p>
                <p>In <i>Caverns and Creatures</i>, embark on an adventure under the wing of your 
                    Lore-Master or with one of our trained and experienced team members at 
                    in person or online live events with Ivy Games.  Immerse yourself in a 
                    magical world that has been enraptured by an ancient curse.  </p>
                <p><i>Caverns and Creatures</i> takes players into the winding depths of the 
                    buried old world in search of solutions to a blight on the world of 
                    Sandalia.  Magic once fueled the blossom of a prosperous golden age 
                    for the diverse races of the world, but that magic has begun to tear 
                    at the world, creating tears in reality allowing denizens of strange 
                    and often hostile realms to warp the world around them.  Those with 
                    access to protective magic retreated into safe isolation leaving most 
                    to fend for themselves without the means to combat the changing world.
                    <br>  
                    Journey deep underground with your intrepid companions to uncover the 
                    mysteries of the old world in search of the lost history of the old ones.  
                    The mysteries of the corrupted ruins of the golden age may hold the key 
                    to restoring the world to peace and prosperity. </p>
