			Current format of the question form:
			Labels describing the QUESTION will be for "question#"; # = current question
			Radio buttons will be labeled "q#answer" to distinguish them as the answer
			for their given question.
			Labels for the ANSWER RADIO BUTTONS will be for "q#a$"; $ = answer number
			
			Additionally, consider where we should include character profiles. Including them
			at the start is fine, although it may skew the user's answers if they know what
			class to expect being assigned as before receiving their results

				If we intend to use the "submit" input at the bottom of the quiz,
				we'll need to specify an action attribute in the "form" element
				(probably for a page to be linked to, although we'll want the
				entered information to be checked via JS. Maybe a button that
				initiates the check is a better decision?) Either way, DO NOT
				use "GET" when appending a method to the action attribute.

<!--
	Updates:
	(11/4) Tidied the code a bit & added a submit button to the end of
	the quiz. Everything else is relatively the same
	-Added the character race-related portion of the quiz (L 167-228)
	-Like last update, please note that this is not the definitive quiz format,
	I remember we talked about possibly showing only one question
	onscreen, etc; we can change this how we seet fit, it's just to
	give a rudimentary idea as to how the quiz *could* look like.	
	
	Recommendations:
	-When we get around to calculating the quiz answers, it may be best to
	tally up the number of times one question is answered (create
	3 variables and code the quiz to tally them up each time there's
	an answer, for example answering question 1 with answer 1 would make
	"q1Total" +1, etc. Then after calculating them we'll compare them to each
	other)
